Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- If you're adding a resource, like a blog post or a video, it must be about Machine Learning, AI, Numerical Analysis or Elixir.
- Also explain why this resource is important. We're curating a list, not aggregating everything.
- Even better if this explanation is in the description for the link, so everyone can see it when
reading the list.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
