# Awesome ML & GenAI in Elixir

A curated list of Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI) packages and resources for the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language.

Besides giving an overview for experienced Elixir developers, this list can be useful for ML and AI practitioners looking for other ecosystems.

## Core Tools

- [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx) - Tensors for Elixir with compilation to CPU/GPU. It is the base for a lot of other libraries.
- [Explorer](https://github.com/elixir-explorer/explorer) - Series and dataframes for data exploration in Elixir.
- [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) - Write interactive and collaborative notebooks, with integrations to databases, messaging, visualization and more.
- [Kino](https://github.com/livebook-dev/kino) - Render rich and interactive output. Used in Livebook.

## Machine Learning

### Traditional Machine Learning

- [Scholar](https://github.com/elixir-nx/scholar) - Traditional machine learning tools built on top of Nx. Implements algorithms for:
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Clustering
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Metrics and preprocessing
- [EXGBoost](https://github.com/acalejos/exgboost) - Decision Trees implemented using the [XGBoost C API](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c.html).
- [Mockinjay](https://github.com/acalejos/mockingjay) - Implementation of Microsoft's [Hummingbird](https://github.com/microsoft/hummingbird) library for converting trained Decision Tree models into Nx tensor computations.
- [Soothsayer](https://github.com/georgeguimaraes/soothsayer) - Time series forecasting library inspired by Facebook's Prophet and NeuralProphet.
- [Ulam](https://github.com/tmbb/ulam_ex) - Elixir interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), a probabilist programming language.

### Deep Learning

- [Axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon) - Neural Networks for Elixir. Built with Nx.
- [Bumblebee](https://github.com/elixir-nx/bumblebee) - Pre-trained neural network models on top of Axon. Provides integration with [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
- [Ortex](https://github.com/elixir-nx/ortex) - Wrapper around ONNX. Enables you to run ONNX models using Nx.

### Computer Vision

- [Evision](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/evision) - OpenCV bindings for Elixir/Erlang.
- [NxImage](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx_image) - Image processing in Nx.

## Generative AI

### LLM Tools
- [Honeycomb](https://github.com/seanmor5/honeycomb) - Fast LLM inference built on Elixir, Bumblebee, and EXLA.
- [Instructor.ex](https://github.com/thmsmlr/instructor_ex) - Structured outputs from LLMs using Ecto schemas. Works with OpenAI, llama.cpp and Bumblebee.

### Agent Frameworks
- [Jido](https://github.com/agentjido/jido) - Framework for building autonomous, distributed agent systems using traditional AI and ML approaches.
- [LangChain](https://github.com/brainlid/langchain) - Framework for developing applications powered by language models, with support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Bumblebee models.
